You're the target audience of my blog, if (like my 6 months past self) you:
- want to deeply understand cutting-edge AI topics to do hands-on research / engineering
- are an experienced coder
- like to understand the full picture top-down

Feel free to get in touch via mail (seckroll16 at gmail.com) or [Twitter (@Raitweet10)](https://x.com/Raitweet10)!

PS: In a previous life I've been a strategy consultant for AI in banking, and I like to create local community by e.g. [organizing street festivals](https://twitter.com/UmerHAdil/status/1718753246309695644).
